# prints random dog training tips - these are just things ive noticed while training my pup

print("Have a nice variety of treats ranging in value.") # use high value for "come"

print('Have a (cue?) word like "yes!" or "good boy!"') # only use while giving treat, then they associate the phrase with a treat

print("Always positive reinforcement forever") # if you notice a behavior you like, give a treat

print("Always keep treats on hand") # you want these to be low value
